Dear Editor,

We are sending the 2nd revised version of our manuscript “Diversity dynamics in
Nymphalidae butterflies: Effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on diversification
rate shift estimates” for your consideration.

We have followed the "minor revision" comments by one of the reviewers.
We are submitting a clean version of our manuscript (as LaTeX source files and
a PDF file generated from those).
We are also submitting a PDF file containing our revised manuscript and all
changes applied during revision appear highlighted.
All supplementary materials have been uploaded using the PLOS website.

We have formatted our TeX file to comply with the recent changes to the layout
requirements by PLOS (updated January 2015).

Sincerely yours,

Carlos Peña & Marianne Espeland
