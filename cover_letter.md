Dear Editor,

We send our manuscript "Diversity dynamics in Nymphalidae butterflies: Effect
of phylogenetic uncertainty on diversification rate shift estimates" for your
consideration.

Part of the findings of this manuscript are the following:

We used as target organisms the butterfly family Nymphalidae.

In this manuscript we found that estimates of diversification produced by
employing the commonly used method MEDUSA are greatly affected by phylogenetic
uncertainty.

We found that many of the diversification splits found by running MEDUSA on the
maximum credibility tree are not found when MEDUSA is run on a random sample of
trees from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian run. In some cases MEDUSA
estimated both increases and decreases in diversification for the very same
clade.

We also explored the evolutionary causes of one of the diversification shifts
that was consistently recovered in our analyses.

We believe that these findings should be published in PLOS ONE as many
evolutionary studies are employing MEDUSA for analysis. Additionally, we
explore the high diversification rate found in the clade Ithomiini and provide
evidence that the evolutionary interactions with their hostplants are
responsible for the high diversification rate, and that this process is
congruent with the diffuse cospeciation hypothesis.

Sincerely yours,


Carlos Pe√±a & Marianne Espeland
