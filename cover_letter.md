Dear Editor,

We are sending the 2nd revised version of our manuscript “Diversity dynamics in
Nymphalidae butterflies: Effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on diversification
rate shift estimates” for your consideration.

We have followed the "minor revision" comments by one of the reviewers.
We are submitting a clean version of our manuscript (as LaTeX source files and
a PDF file generated from those).
We are also submitting a PDF file containing our revised manuscript and all
changes applied during revision appear highlighted.
All supplementary materials have been uploaded to the public repository Figshare:
http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1116238 and the URL has been included
in our resubmittion.

Sincerely yours,
