# Response to reviewers

## Reviewer 1

**1. Reviewer's Comment:**

Introduction
1. Second paragraph, second sentence: The fact that the Nymphalids are the “largest family” of butterflies conveys an exaggerated importance of their diversity based on idiosyncrasy of Linnean taxonomy (the sister group to Nymphalidae, the clade that includes riodinids and lycaenids, has over 6500 species). Consider revising the sentence, omitting superlatives (“biggest”, “largest”, “most”, etc.).

**1. Response:**

> We have rewritten the sentence to:
> "Nymphalidae contains around 6000 species [6], and several members are
considered model organisms in evolutionary biology [7–9]."

**2. Reviewer's Comment:**

The authors should mention that the ideal approach would accommodate uncertainty by sampling from a distribution of trees which reflected the variation in confidence in various parts of the tree (such as a Bayesian posterior distribution or a bootstrap sample). See Holder,M. and Lewis,P.O. (2003) Phylogeny estimation: traditional and Bayesian approaches. Nat. Rev. Genet., 4, 275–284

> We have specified that the sample of trees was taken from the Bayesian run in
Wahlberg et al., 2009.
